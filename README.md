# Power Consumption Time series Forecasting
 
# Temporal Data Analysis and Forecasting with Python

## Introduction

In this project, I explored the fundamentals of temporal data analysis and forecasting using a dataset on electric power consumption in Tetouan, a city located in the north of Morocco. The dataset covers one year of electricity usage data, providing a rich source for understanding patterns, trends, and making predictions.
